In response to demand from our clients, Infinity Works has developed an integrated design and research service as part of our expansion to offer a full service offering. As a fast-growing consultancy with offices in Leeds, Manchester, London and Edinburgh, it's important for us to develop a more user-focused delivery that drives better outcomes through the product lifecycle from discovery to live.

Infinity Works CTO Dan Rathbone said: "We've always incorporated a level of user design and customer experience into our work, as well as working with a couple of brilliant partners who specialise in these skills. However, we think it's so important to be able to offer all of these capabilities that we're now bringing them in-house under one team."

"Our teams are so closely intertwined and if they can work on a new service or product from its conception, through to development, then it makes collaboration, creativity and efficiency even easier."

"We are already seeing this valuable new team expanding and look forward to seeing the fruition of some exciting projects in 2020."

## Why is design and research important to what we do?

As a team of technologists and engineers at heart, we believe in the power of design to humanise technology. And more than that, we believe that all customer-facing technologies and interactions should be intuitive and easy to use from the off-set.

Service design is critical to overall customer experience, but needs to be focussed on from a very early stage in product development. Analysts Forrester says we are now in the age of the customer, where the most successful companies take the time to understand what their customers actually want, because if they don't get it, they will go elsewhere.

Of course, there is no better way to achieve this than to create a unified offering and cohesive delivery team. Our approach helps accelerate time-to-market, validate ideas quickly and deliver experiences that turn users into advocates.
For our clients, we believe in the power of design to deliver value for organisations, drive strategic change and improve people's lives.

## What do we offer?

* Customer experience strategy
