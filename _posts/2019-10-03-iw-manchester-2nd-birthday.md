![Our Manchester office is two!]({{ "/images/IW_2nd_birthday.jpg" }})

Our fast-growing Manchester team celebrated with craft beer, prosecco and a giant cake this week as we reached our second birthday. From our initial launch in the rainy city with just one consultant in a co-working space through to having just taken on our 50th person, the last two years have really flown by. Growth has been rapid as we’ve grown a reputation in Manchester to rival the amazing existing teams in both Leeds and London.

It’s been a fast-paced time as we’ve managed projects large and small, across a wide variety of sectors like transport, healthcare, retail, education, and telecoms - just to name a few. We’ve worked with some amazing companies, some incredibly talented people and developed our technological capabilities infinitely.

The range of services provided by the local team continues to grow too, extending from the agile, cloud-native engineering that we focused on initially, through digital transformation including AWS serverless, data engineering, service design and Internet of Things offerings since then.

As well as client work, our team here have been active contributors to many local tech events, giving us the chance to share some knowledge, experience and skills with the community.

We continued the [DevOps Battle Royale](https://www.meetup.com/The-DevOps-Battle-Royale/) event series this year, providing a forum for enthusiasts to hotly contest the merits of rival technologies, including AWS vs Azure vs GCP, Secrets Management, Containers vs Serverless and others. We run it as an inclusive event that encourages people to learn through workshops, Q&As, live votes and a generally a fun atmosphere on the evening - no ‘death by Powerpoint’ here!

We also launched the [Infinity Works 101](https://www.meetup.com/Infinity-Works-101-Sessions/events/265087468/) sessions in the last year, which are a series of free to attend, sequential hands-on workshops designed to give a good intro to some of the technologies we use at Infinity Works and want to share with the community. Topics covered so far this year include: Golang, AWS Serverless, GraphQL, Docker and Kubernetes for example.

As part of our drive to increase diversity across all of our offices, we are also sponsoring the fantastic Reframe Women in Tech conference later this month in Manchester. Outside of the office we held a family summer barbecue in Didsbury, as well as joining the entire Infinity Works team at our annual Center Parcs conference and weekend away.

Having swiftly outgrown our fourth office on King Street, we are in the process of deciding on a new office space that will allow us to double in size again. It looks like 2020 is going to be pretty busy again for our Manchester team - there’s no slowdown in sight!

If you’re interested in joining the team, we currently have a number of engineering roles with skills including cloud computing, serverless, Go, Python, .Net, Java and DevOps in Manchester so please contact [recruitment-manchester@infinityworks.com](mailto:recruitment-manchester@infinityworks.com) for more details.
